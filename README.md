# CX North Carolina Campaign Finance Project

Open source tools for working with campaign finance data in North Carolina

## Overview

This project is intended to supplement, enhance, and make more accessible the campaign finance data coming out of the NC State Board of Elections. It is an open source project with an intent to serve as a collaboration mechanism for anyone interested in accessing, analyzing, or visualizing these data sets. While most of the development tooling will exist in this repo, there will be external resources implemented - such as an open data portal - to allow non-developers to access the project output.

The goals of this project are:
1. Scrape, download, and aggregate raw data from the NC SBoE
2. Transcribe image-based, PDF reports into machine-readable data
3. Publish code, infrastructure, and running implementations to this repository
4. Publish all data output to an open data portal
5. Publish a set of reusable visualizations based on the open data output

## Project Status

For the most part the project status will be published on our [Github Project Board](https://github.com/CrossroadsCX/nc-campaign-finance/projects/1) with any material code / implentation changes included in our readmes

## Packages

This project is structured as a monorepo using Lerna to manage separate packages. These can be found in the [packages directory](./packages) with their own corresponding documentation
